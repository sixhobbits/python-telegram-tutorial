# Building a chatbot with Python and Telegram
This is the code for a series of Tutorials that I am writing for Code Mentor. 

Part 1 of the tutorial is already published and can be found here: https://www.codementor.io/python/tutorial/building-a-telegram-bot-using-python-part-1. It walks you through building an echobot (a bot that echoes your messages back to you) from scratch using Python and Telegram.

Part 2 of the tutorial shows you how to add a database to your chatbot so that it can have long-term memory. As an example, we build a basic To Do list that allows users to add and remove text items.

Part 3 of the tutorial will be in the form of a live office hour video where I show how to deploy the bot to a VPS.
